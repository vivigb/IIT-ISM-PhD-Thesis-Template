\begin{itemize}
    \item Advanced Seismic Source Characterization:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Develop algorithms to refine seismic source parameters, such as moment tensor inversion and focal mechanism analysis, for better understanding of fault dynamics.
        \item Explore the relationship between source depth variations and regional stress fields to enhance seismic hazard assessments.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Seismic Wave Propagation in Complex Media:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Investigate the propagation of seismic waves through anisotropic and heterogeneous crustal structures to improve regional velocity models.
        \item Conduct numerical simulations to assess the impact of topography and subsurface complexity on wave propagation characteristics.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Integration of Geophysical and Geodetic Data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Integrate InSAR and GPS data with seismic observations to study deformation patterns and fault slip rates in the study region.
        \item Use combined datasets to constrain interseismic coupling models and evaluate seismic cycle processes.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Long-Term Monitoring and Hazard Prediction:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Establish a network of broadband seismic stations and other geophysical sensors to continuously monitor changes in crustal stress and strain.
        \item Develop early warning systems by coupling real-time data streams with machine learning models for short-term earthquake forecasting.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Role of Fluids in Seismic Activity:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Investigate the influence of fluids on fault mechanics and seismic triggering by analyzing seismic velocity changes over time.
        \item Examine relationships between fluid migration, pore pressure variations, and induced seismicity in tectonically active regions.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
