The journey of completing this PhD has been one of the most transformative and rewarding experiences of my life, and it would not have been possible without the support, guidance, and encouragement of several remarkable individuals. \par

First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Eleanor H. Carter, whose unwavering support, insightful guidance, and constant encouragement have been the cornerstone of this work. Her mentorship has been invaluable not only in my academic journey but also in shaping my career and personal growth.\par

I am also profoundly grateful to my committee members, Prof. Jonathan R. Lake and Dr. Melissa D. Harper, for their constructive feedback and thoughtful suggestions, which have significantly enriched the quality of this research.\par

A special acknowledgment goes to my colleagues and friends in the Advanced Geoscience Research Group, particularly Dr. Alex V. Bennett and Ms. Clara E. Reynolds, for the countless stimulating discussions, collaborations, and unwavering camaraderie. Their support has been a source of inspiration throughout this journey.\par

I extend my heartfelt thanks to the administrative staff of Willowbrook University, especially Ms. Diana L. Quinn and Mr. Steven R. Hayes, for their constant assistance with all logistical matters.\par

On a personal note, I am deeply indebted to my parents, Mr. Gregory J. Monroe and Mrs. Evelyn T. Monroe, for their unconditional love, encouragement, and sacrifices that have made this journey possible. To my siblings, Emma L. Monroe and Christopher J. Monroe, thank you for always believing in me.\par

Finally, to my closest friend and confidant, Sarah F. Mitchell, your unwavering support and faith in me have been my anchor through the highs and lows of this endeavour.\par
