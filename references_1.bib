	abstract = {The seismotectonic of the Kangra–Chamba region, the source zone of the 1905 great Kangra earthquake (M 8.0), has been studied analysing about 350 local earthquakes recorded by broadband seismological network under operation in {NW} Himalaya. The study reveals that the seismic activity is concentrated to the north of surface trace of the Main Boundary Thrust, Panjal Thrust and Chamba Thrust. The hypocenters are conﬁned within 40 km depth with higher concentration in the uppermost crust. Fault plane solutions of 41 selected local earthquakes are examined. The fault plane solutions for shallow earthquakes ({\textbackslash}10 km) predominantly shows thrust mechanisms, whereas earthquakes below *10 km depth shows normal faulting mechanism. The stress tensor study reveals maximum compressional stress (r1) with trends 29°N and plunges at 6°, and the minimum stress (r3) trends at 134°N and plunges at 67° in the upper 10-km crust favouring thrust mechanism of the earthquakes with a {NE}-directed regional compressive stress. In the deeper part, r1 trends at 244°N and plunges at 59° while r3 shows extension trending at 9°N with a plunge of 20° giving evidence of extensional tectonics in the central part of the study area. The {NE}-dipping thrust sheets existing in the region as well as {SW}-dipping Chenab Normal Fault merges with the detachment that creates a complex tectonic interaction which is responsible for generating normal faulting earthquakes below the detachment plane.},

	abstract = {Rupture in the 2015 M7.8 Gorkha earthquake nucleated at the downdip edge of the Main Himalayan Thrust ({MHT}) near the transition from interseismic locking to aseismic creep beneath the Tibetan plateau, and propagated incompletely towards the Main Frontal Thrusts ({MFT}). Despite the imposition of a substantial static strain in the middécollement, afterslip on the {MHT} within a year of the earthquake had decayed to negligible levels. Earthquakes that incompletely rupture the {MHT} (7{\textless}Mw{\textless}7.9) have been relatively common in the past two centuries, and as a consequence heterogeneous patches of stored elastic strain must exist throughout the Himalaya similar to that emplaced by the Gorkha earthquake. We show that these patches of stored strain are not dissipated by creep or by subsequent updip earthquakes, with the possible exception of a sequence of moderate earthquakes to the east of the great 1950 Assam earthquake. It is thus considered likely that mid-décollement strain newly imposed by the Gorkha earthquake, and other recent incomplete ruptures will be incorporated in the rupture of a future much larger earthquake. Incomplete ruptures (i.e. those that nucleate downdip but fail to rupture the frontal thrusts) appear to occur preferentially in parts of the central Himalaya characterized by relatively narrow transition regions of interseismic decoupling ({\textless}30 km downdip). Assuming uniform strain at failure these narrow zones are unable to store large amounts of strain energy compared to wide zones of interseismic decoupling. Since the transition from fully locked to a fully creeping rheology depends partly on temperature, to first order the width of the interseismic decoupling transition zone depends on the local dip of the {MHT}. Where the decoupling zone is narrow (25 km) moderate earthquakes (6{\textless}Mw{\textless}7) are observed to occur at intervals of a few hundred years. Where the transition zone is wide (e.g. Kashmir and Assam, 150 km) great earthquakes nucleate at long time intervals (millennia). Because the cumulative moment release of moderate earthquakes in regions of narrow seismic decoupling is insufficient to keep up with plate convergence, we conclude that megaquakes that eventually sweep through these regions are augmented by the heterogenous fossil strain of former incomplete ruptures. Because great earthquakes in the central Himalaya are inferred to nucleate from moderate earthquakes near the base of the {MHT}, the preparation zones of these moderate earthquakes may provide opportunities for forecasting the approach of future great earthquakes.},

	abstract = {Periodic earthquake occurrences may reﬂect links with semidiurnal to multiyear tides, seasonal hydrological loads, and {\textasciitilde}14 month pole tide forcing. The Schuster spectrum is a recent extension of Schuster’s traditional test for periodicity analysis in seismology. We present an alternative approach: the multifrequential periodogram analysis ({MFPA}), performed on time series of monthly earthquake numbers. We explore if seismicity in two central California regions, the Central San Andreas Fault near Parkﬁeld ({CSAF}-{PKD}) and the Sierra Nevada-Eastern California Shear Zone ({SN}-{ECSZ}), exhibits periodic behavior at periods of 2 months to several years. Original and declustered catalogs spanning up to 26 years were analyzed with both methods. For {CSAF}-{PKD}, the {MFPA} resolves {\textasciitilde}1 year periodicities, with additional statistically signiﬁcant periods of {\textasciitilde}6 and {\textasciitilde}4 months; for {SN}-{ECSZ}, it ﬁnds a strong {\textasciitilde}14 month periodic component. Unlike the Schuster spectrum, the {MFPA} has an exact modiﬁed statistic at non-Fourier frequencies. Informed by the {MFPA} period estimates, trigonometric models with periods of 12, 6, and 4 months (Model 1) and 14.24 and 12 months (Model 2) were ﬁtted to time series of earthquake numbers. For {CSAF}-{PKD}, Model 1 shows a peak annual earthquake occurrence during August-November and a secondary peak in April. Similar peaks, or troughs, are found in annual and semiannual components of pole tide and tide-induced stress model time series and fault normal-stress reduction from seasonal hydrological unloading. For {SN}-{ECSZ}, the dominant {\textasciitilde}14 month periodicity prevents regular annual peaking, and Model 2 provides a better ﬁt (ΔRa2djusted: 2.4\%). This new {MFPA} application resolves several periodicities in earthquake catalogs that reveal external periodic forcing.},

	abstract = {Investigations of micro- and low-magnitude earthquakes in the Kangra-Chamba region of the {NW} Himalaya were performed to evaluate the relationship between earthquake source, seismicity, stress drop, tectonics, and structure. The seismic events were recorded by a dense local network of 21 permanent/temporary stations during 2004–2005. The earthquake source parameters using spectral analysis were calculated for reﬁned epicenters obtained by Local Earthquake Tomography method. We applied two approaches of spectral analysis for earthquake data and the box-counting fractal dimension for structural elements in order to understand the seismogenesis of the region properly. These two methods giving interdependable results were used for the study area that extends from latitude 31.5°N–33.5°N and longitude 75.5°E–77.5°E in the epicenter zone of devastating 1905 Kangra earthquake. The seismic moment of these earthquakes (1.5 B Mw B 4.8) is between 1.21E ? 18 dyne-cm and 1.44E ? 23 dyne-cm causing circular deformation of radius in the range 0.12–1.15 km based on Brune’s circular model. The study reveals that low value for the capacity fractal dimension (D0 of 0.678) and seismically intense clustering of 135 earthquakes with low stress drops generally below 10 bar but up to 26 bar. Evaluated low stress drop of small size earthquakes and low D0 of structural elements has led to the identiﬁcation of nature of brittleness of the crust and proneness to high strain accumulation that indicates the presence of an asperity/barrier in the fault zones. The variation of b value and 3D seismic velocities supports the presence of asperity zone.},

	abstract = {To investigate subsurface structure and seismogenic layers, 3D velocity inversion was carried out in the source zone of 1905 Kangra earthquake (M8.0) in the northwestern Himalaya. P-wave and S-wave phase data of 159 earthquakes recorded by a network of 21 stations were used for this purpose. Inverted velocity tomograms up to a depth range of 18 km show signiﬁcant variations of 14\% in Vp and Vs and 6\% in the Vp/Vs across the major tectonic zones in the region. Synthesis of seismicity pattern, velocity structure, distinctive focal mechanisms coupled with nature of stress distribution allows mapping of three different source regions that control regional seismotectonics. Accumulating strains are partly consumed by sliding of Chamba Nappe to the southwest through reverse-fault movements along Chamba/Panjal/Main Boundary Thrusts. This coupled with normal-fault type displacements along Chenab Normal Fault in the north account for low magnitude widespread seismicity in upper 8–10 km of the crust. At intermediate depths from 8 to 15 km, adjusting to residual compressive stresses, the detachment or lower end of the {MBT} slips to produce thrust dominated seismicity. Nucleation of secondary stresses in local {NE}–{SW} oriented structure interacts in complex manner with regional stresses to generate normal type earthquakes below the plane of detachment and therefore three seismic regimes at different depths produce intense seismicity in a block of 30 Â 30 km2 centered {NE} to the epicenter of Kangra earthquake.},

	abstract = {The existing seismological network in the Kangra–Chamba sector has been upgraded with 12 three-component digital seismometers to obtain new insight on the nature and sources of continued clustered seismicity in this part of northwest Himalaya. A combination of travel-time-distance plots and travel-time inversion of P and S phases have been used to derive a 1D velocity model for the region. The minimum 1D velocity model divides the average 44 km thick crust into four layers. The top ∼10 km thick layer represents the metamorphosed sediments of the Chamba nappe that dominates the surface geology of the study area. Suggestion of a thin low-velocity layer at 15 km depth possibly marks the detachment zone separating the downgoing Indian plate from the overriding wedge. The improved locations of epicenters show close clustering of seismic events immediately northeast of the epicenter of the 1905 Kangra earthquake, while away from this zone the seismicity in the Chamba sector has more even distribution. In the later sector, space-depth distribution of hypocenters suggests that strain resulting from the ongoing collision of the Indian plate with Asia is being consumed by reverse-fault movement on the Chamba thrust. The clustered seismicity in the Kangra sector has three distinct source regions and mechanisms: (1) southward displacement of the thick Chamba nappe sheet over the Panjal imbricate zone along the Panjal thrust accounts for the seismicity at shallow depths of less than 7 km, (2) the nucleation of strains where the northeast dipping main boundary thrust ({MBT}) merges with the detachment plane produces focused seismicity near this junction, and (3) the seismicity in a small pocket below the plane of detachment appears to be a consequence of stresses generated at the base of the northeast dipping detachment plane by the transverse structure.},

	abstract = {Spread over countries including Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, and China, the Himalayan mountain chain, the most spectacular result of the Indo-Eurasian plate collision, is a locus of destructive earthquakes. Past earthquakes from this region have impacted vast swathes of frontal Himalaya and stretches of alluvial plains south of the range front. Risk from future earthquakes has increased, considering the burgeoning population and an everexpanding built-environment in the region. While considerable ambiguities exist on the locations, ruptures, and sizes of the earthquakes during the ﬁrst half of the last millennium (1255, 1344, and 1505 {CE}), those during the latter half (1803 and 1833 {CE}) are quite well-documented, all reported from the central Himalayan segment comprising eastern Nepal, Kumaun, and Garhwal. While dormancy prevailed in the central segment in the intervening period, the Himalayan arc elsewhere witnessed three large/great earthquakes in the last century, namely, 1905 Kangra (Mw 7.8), 1934 Bihar-Nepal (Mw 8.2), and 1950 Upper Assam (Mw 8.6), the last one being the largest intra-continental earthquake in the recorded history. The April 25, Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake (Mw 7.8) located in the central seismic gap terminated the period of low-level seismic productivity that followed the 1950 event. The Himalayan arc and its contiguous regions are now being investigated using various tools including paleoseismology. Quite understandably, the interpretations and tectonic models do not always converge, given the diverse quality and type of data. The data from variously sized modern-day earthquakes sourced in the diverse structural settings of the Himalaya provide better constraints on the source properties of the Himalayan earthquakes. The source complexity and diversity is a striking point of interest for the post-1950 events, and at least some of them seem to deviate from the generally accepted model of great ruptures on a shallow dipping detachment. A prime example of such anomalies is the 2005 Kashmir earthquake (Mw 7.6) sourced on an out-ofsequence thrust. The sources of the 1991 Uttarkashi (Mw 6.8), 1999 Chamoli (Mw 6.6), and the 2015 Gorkha (Nepal) (Mw 7.8) earthquakes - all in the central Himalayan segment - are attributed to the ramp-ﬂat on the down-dip part of the Main Himalayan Thrust ({MHT}). In contrast, the 2011 Sikkim (Mw 6.9) and the 2016 Imphal (Mw 6.7) earthquakes are intraplate events sourced within the subducting slab. Source models of modern-day earthquakes (1991–2016) discussed in this paper bring out this plurality of mechanisms expected of a complex subduction-cum-collisional boundary. This review presents the status of current seismotectonic understanding of the Himalaya from the analyses of signiﬁcant earthquakes, from the past as well as recent events with a focus on the central Himalayan segment.},

The epicenters of these events are located at the northern front of the Berinag Thrust in its hanging wall. To better understand the seismotectonics of this region, we analyzed the spectral source parameters and source mechanism of this swam activity. Spectral analysis shows the low stress drop values (from 0.05 to 28.9 bars), suggesting that the upper crust has low strength to withstand accumulated strain energy in this region. The Moment Tensor solutions of 12 earthquakes (≥2.7ML) obtained by waveform inversion yield the shallow centroid depths between 5 and 10 km. All these events are of dominantly thrust fault mechanism having an average dip angle of ∼30°. The P-axes and the maximum horizontal compressive stresses are {NE}-{SW} oriented; the relative motion of the Indian Plate. The present study reveals that the swarm activity in the Himachal region of {NW} Himalaya is related to the out-of-sequence thrusting or the Lesser Himalayan Duplex system.},

In the recent years, there has been a signiﬁcant increase in the number of focal mechanisms available for the entire rift system, and it is now possible to estimate the present-day stress ﬁeld in relative detail based on seismotectonic data alone.},

We locate 206 earthquakes with a local magnitude in the range of 1.5 to 4.9 and calculate {FPSs} of 19 selected earthquakes based on moment tensor solutions. The earthquakes are distributed throughout the study region and indicate active tectonics in this region. The observed seismicity pattern is quite different than a well-defined pattern of seismicity, along the Main Central Thrust zone, in the eastern side of the study region (i.e., Kumaon-Garhwal Himalaya). In the Himalaya region, the earthquakes are distributed in the crust and upper mantle, whereas in the Ladakh-Karakoram area the earthquakes are mostly confined up to crustal depths. The fault plane solutions show a mixture of thrust, normal and strike-slip type mechanisms, which are well corroborated with the known faults/tectonics of the region. The normal fault earthquakes are observed along the Southern Tibet Detachment, Zanskar Shear Zone, Tso-Morari dome, and Kaurik-Chango fault; and suggest E-W extension tectonics in the Higher and Tethys Himalaya. The earthquakes of thrust mechanism with the left-lateral strike-slip component are seen along the Kistwar fault. The right-lateral strike-slip faulting with thrust component along the bending of the Main Boundary Thrust and Main Central Thrust shows the transpressional tectonics in this part of the Himalaya. The observed earthquakes with right-lateral strike-slip faulting indicate seismically active nature of the Karakoram fault.},

	abstract = {Background: Structures such as faults, joints and fractures of diverse patterns have acted as precursors of several slope instability cases within the Benue Trough Nigeria. In some cases, the structures by their nature weakened and also created avenues that streams took advantage to further destabilize the rock slopes. In other cases, structure orientation played significant roles in the mobility and eventual runout distance of debris flow and avalanches in the region. Detailed field-based structural, fracture and paleostress analyses were therefore carried out to determine the fractural patterns that correlate to reported instability and landslide cases in the region; and to produce models that reveal areas with heightened risk.
Results: Three fracture sets were isolated from analysis of fracture orientations and field relationships: Pre-folding ({JT}), Syn-Folding ({JS}) and Post Folding ({JC}) fracture systems. Paleostress analysis carried out on these fracture systems using the {TENSOR}™ software tool yielded three paleostress tensors corresponding to transtensional stress tensor with {ENE}-{WSW} direction of maximum extension ({SHMIN}), oblique compressive (transpressional) tensor with {NW}-{SE} direction of maximum shortening ({SHMAX}), and transtensional tensor with {WNW}-{ESE} direction of maximum extension ({SHMIN}).
Conclusion: These tensors are related to the prevailing plate tectonic stress regimes affecting the entire Benue trough and the West and Central African Rift System ({WCARS}). Our pre- and post-tectonic models have revealed the reasons for instability and the likely places where future failures may be located. This is the first such analyses in the region and it is hoped that the results can broaden the use and applicability of paleostresses in failure-prone terrains for future risk and disaster reduction/assessment within the Trough and in other areas prone to structurecontrolled landslides disaster.},

Earthquakes between November 1976 and April 2019 in the depth range of 10–258 km with moment magnitudes between 4.6 and 7.9 were selected. High-quality solutions were inverted to locate the best ﬁtting stress tensor. Most of the earthquake fault plane solutions indicated thrust faulting, conﬁrming northward underthrusting of the Indian plate along the Main Boundary Thrust and the Main Central Thrust systems and eastward underthrusting along the Burmese Arc. The focal mechanisms indicated right-lateral motion along the Karakoram Fault and left-lateral motion along the Kirthar–Sulaiman Range, which agrees with the expected sense of the lateral mass movement of the continental collision model. The present-day stress regimes obtained from the earthquake focal mechanism inversions indicated a predominantly compressional stress regime represented by {NNE}–{SSW} trending normal fault mechanisms in northwest India and Nepal and {NNW}–{SSE} trending normal fault mechanisms in Pakistan and Hindukush. These are consistent with the direction of the ongoing India–Eurasia plate collision and the extensional stress of {WNW}–{ESE} trending thrust faulting in the Xizang and Kashmir regions. These tectonic regimes connected with the major tectonic affecting the Arabian Peninsula. Accordingly, it is highly recommended to assess the earthquake hazards of the major cities in the eastern countries of Arabian Peninsula as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Oman.},

	abstract = {We characterize the present-day stress state in and around the Korean Peninsula using formal inversions of earthquake focal mechanisms. Two different methods are used to select preferred fault planes in the double-couple focal mechanism solutions: one that minimizes average misﬁt angle and the other choosing faults with higher instability. We invert selected sets of fault planes for estimating the principal stresses at regularly spaced grid points, using a circular-area data-binning method, where the bin radius is optimized to yield the best possible stress inversion results based on the World Stress Map quality ranking scheme. The inversions using the two methods yield well constrained and fairly comparable results, which indicate that the prevailing stress regime is strike-slip, and the maximum horizontal principal stress ({SHmax}) is oriented {ENE}–{WSW} throughout the study region. Although the orientation of the stresses is consistent across the peninsula, the relative stress magnitude parameter (R-value) varies signiﬁcantly, from 0.22 in the northwest to 0.89 in the southeast. Based on our knowledge of the R-values and stress regime, and using a value for vertical stress (Sv) estimated from the overburden weight of rock, together with a value for the maximum differential stress (based on the Coulomb friction of faults optimally oriented for slip), we estimate the magnitudes of the two horizontal principal stresses. The horizontal stress magnitudes increase from west to east such that {SHmax}/Sv ratio rises from 1.5 to 2.4, and the Shmin/Sv ratio from 0.6 to 0.8. The variation in the magnitudes of the tectonic stresses appears to be related to differences in the rigidity of crustal rocks. Using the complete stress tensors, including both orientations and magnitudes, we assess the possible ranges of frictional coefﬁcients for different types of faults. We show that normal and reverse faults have lower frictional coefﬁcients than strike-slip faults, suggesting that the former types of faults can be activated under a strike-slip stress regime. Our observations of the seismicity, with normal faulting concentrated offshore to the northwest and reverse faulting focused offshore to the east, are compatible with the results of our estimates of stress magnitudes.},

            The optimum 1D velocity model is calculated for the Kinnaur sector of the {NW} Himalaya utilizing the arrival time information of the local earthquakes (137 no.) recorded with 12 broadband seismic network within the azimuthal gap of ≤180°. This optimum 1D velocity model is a five-layer model and ranges from the surface to 90 km in the shallow mantle. P velocity varies from 5.5 km/s to 8.6 km/s in the crust and upper mantle, and S-wave velocity varies between 3.2 km/s and 4.9 km/s for the same range. When we relocated the earthquakes with the Joint Hypocenter Determination program incorporating the optimum 1D velocity model, it resulted in a lower {RMS} residual error of 0.23 s for the hypocenter locations compared to initial hypo71 locations. A total of 1274 P and 1272 S arrival times were utilized to compute station delays. We observed positive variations in P-station delays from -0.19 s below the {PULG} station to 0.11 s below the {SRHN} station. Similarly, for S-station delays, we observed negative delays at each individual site from -0.65 s at {LOSR} station to -0.16 s at the {SRHN} station. This large variation in P- and S-station delays corresponds to the 3D nature of the subsurface below the Kinnaur Himalaya. The relocated seismicity is clustered along the {STD} fault at sub-Moho and Moho depths ranging between 40 km and 80 km. The seismicity distribution aligned across the strike of the {STD} and along the strike of the Kaurik-Chango fault ({KCF}) can be attributed to the cross-fault interactions of the {KCF} and the {STD} fault in the area. We also observed bimodal depth distribution of seismicity in the Higher and Tethys Himalayas. The occurrence of earthquakes down to a depth of {\textasciitilde}0-40 km and 50-80 km in the study area can be interpreted in terms of stress contribution from interseismic stress loading associated with the India-Eurasia collision tectonics. The presence of hypocentres in the shallow mantle at 120 km depth highlights the strength of the mantle, which seems to be deforming in a brittle manner below the region. The computed focal mechanisms exhibit generally the flexing of the Indian plate below the Lesser Himalaya with shear parallel to the strike of the {MCT} and extension orthogonal to it. This study shows deformation over the entire crust and shallow upper mantle levels, with differential stress conditions. Thus, we can consider the crust and the shallow upper mantle down to depths of 120 km to be seismogenic in nature and is capable of producing the microseismicity beneath the Kinnaur Himalaya.},

            The Himalayan Mountain System ({HMS}) and the Tibetan Plateau ({TP}) represent an active mountain belt, with continent-continent collision. Geological and geophysical (seismological modeling, seismic reflection, and gravity) data is reviewed herein for an overview of the lithospheric deformation and active tectonics of this orogen. Shallow crustal deformation with dominance of thrusting along the margins of the {TP} is interpreted with normal faulting in the center and strike-slip deformation with the lateral translation of blocks, over a wedge of ductile deformation. The seismicity is the linear concentration over the margins of the orogen to {\textasciitilde}20 km depth with exception of the Hindukush and Pamir having seismicity to 300 km depth with an interpretation of sinking Indian and Asian lithospheres. The lithospheric structure is represented by mechanically weak surfaces representing décollement to 15 km depth over the basement, low-velocity zone ({LVZ}) at {\textasciitilde}20 km, the Moho at {\textasciitilde}40-82 km, and the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary ({LAB}) at 130-200 km depth. The décollement, termed as the Himalayan Mountain Thrust ({HMT}), is inferred to be rooted at the base of the Moho in central Tibet. Along this fault, brittle crustal deformation is interpreted to {\textasciitilde}15-20 km depth, with brittle-ductile deformation along {LVZ} and ductile slip with crustal duplexing along the lower crust. The mantle lithosphere of the Indian plate is inferred as duplicated with the wedging of the Asian mantle lithosphere. The active tectonics of the {TP} is proposed to follow the mechanics of thrusting, similar to the foreland deformation of the mountain belts and accretionary prisms.},

Focal Mechanism Solutions ({FMSs}) of 13 selected earthquakes were computed through waveform inversion of three-component broadband records. Depth distribution of the earthquakes and {FMSs} of local earthquakes obtained by waveform inversion reveal kinematics of the major fault zones present in eastern Ladakh. A most pronounced cluster of seismicity is observed in the Karakoram Fault ({KF}) zone down to a depth of {\textasciitilde}65 km. The {FMSs} reveal a transpressive environment with an inferred strike slip fault plane parallel to the {KF}. It is argued that the {KF} penetrates down to the lower crust and is a manifestation of active underthrusting of Indian lower crust beneath Tibet. Two clusters of microseismicity are observed at a depth range 5–20 km at the northwestern and southeastern fringes of the Tso Morari gneiss dome, which can be correlated to the activities along the Zildat fault and Karzok fault, respectively. The {FMSs} obtained for representative earthquakes show thrust fault solutions for the Karzok fault, and normal fault solutions for the Zildat fault. It is suggested that the Zildat fault is acting as a detachment, facilitating the exhumation of the Tso Morari dome. On the other hand, the Tso Morari dome is underthrusting the Karzok ophiolite at its southern margin along the Karzok fault due to gravity collapse.},

These earthquakes show a mixture of thrust, normal and strike-slip type mechanism, with a majority of thrust type. Most of the thrust earthquakes occur at a depth of 8–22 km in the Main Central Thrust ({MCT}) zone and the Lower Himalaya. The spatial distribution of these earthquakes suggest that the strain resulting from the ongoing collision of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate is being consumed by thrust fault movement mainly on the north dipping Munsiari Thrust and south dipping Tons Thrust. The strike-slip earthquakes are mainly observed in the Lower Himalaya as well as around the Munsiari region in the {MCT} zone. The normal earthquakes are also observed in different parts of the Kumaon–Garhwal Himalaya and the Gangetic plain. Their occurrence is attributed to the local structure(s) as well as the ﬂexure of the Indian plate. Stress tensor inversion of the calculated fault plane solutions indicates that the maximum compressive stress in the Gangetic plain is N–S directed and near vertical; whereas in the Kumaon–Garhwal Himalaya, it is near horizontal and {NNE}–{SSW} directed, and correlating with the prevailing stress condition due to northward movement of Indian plate.},

The seismicity and seismotectonics of the Kumaon Himalaya and the adjacent region have been investigated based on local earthquake data recorded at 18 seismological stations. The seismically active zone of the eastern segment of the Kumaon Himalaya deviates from the usual pattern of seismicity in the Himalayan Seismic Belt of the {NW} Himalaya. Shallow-focus earthquakes in this region largely concentrate in the Chiplakot Crystalline Belt ({CCB}) immediately south of the Vaikrita Thrust. The Focal Mechanism Solutions of 41 earth­ quakes computed through waveform inversion technique along with the solutions of 12 earthquakes obtained from the Global Centroid Moment Tensor solution catalog are used to investigate the kinematics of the region. The study reveals a complex faulting pattern in the Inner Lesser Himalaya. The stress inversion results show a widely distributed stress pattern and low frictional coefficient which are attributed as one of the major causes of clustered seismicity observed in the {CCB}. Careful examination of the fault orientations indicate the presence of a hinterland dipping Lesser Himalayan Duplex over the ramp structure on the Main Himalayan Thrust. The high compressive stress and deformation rate in the {CCB} are partially accommodated by this duplex structure. The large concentration of shallow-focus earthquakes in the {CCB} is the result of the presence of fluid-rich zone as well as strain localization and large stress build-up due to locking in the ramp structure on the Main Himalayan Thrust beneath the {CCB}.},

            The possibility of a major earthquake like 2015 Gorkha–Nepal or even greater is anticipated in the Garhwal–Kumaun region in the Central Seismic Gap of the {NW} Himalaya. The interseismic strain-rate from {GPS} derived crustal velocities show multifaceted strain-rate pattern in the region and are classified into four different strain-rate zones. Besides compressional, we identified two {NE}–{SW} orienting low strain rate ({\textasciitilde} 20 nstrain/a) zones; namely, the Ramganga-Baijro and the Nainital-Almora, where large earthquakes can occur. These zones have surface locking widths of {\textasciitilde} 72 and {\textasciitilde} 75 km respectively from the Frontal to the Outer Lesser Himalaya, where no significant surface rupture and associated large earthquakes were observed for the last 100 years. However, strain reducing extensional deformation zone that appears sandwiched between the low strain-rate zones pose uncertainties on the occurences of large earthquakes in the locked zone. Nevertheless, such zone acts as a conduit to transfer strain from the compressional zone ({\textgreater} 100 nstrain/a) to the deforming frontal active fault systems. We also observed a curvilinear surface strain-rate pattern in the Chamoli cluster and explained how asymmetric crustal accommodation processes at the northwest and the southeast edges of the Almora Klippe, cause clockwise rotational couple on the upper crust moving over the {MHT}.},

              The magnitude time-series of the global seismicity is analyzed by the empirical mode decomposition giving rise to 14 intrinsic mode functions ({IMF}) and a trend. Using Hurst analysis one can identify three different sums of these {IMFs} and the trend which exhibit distinct multifractal behaviour and correspond to micro-, mid- and macro-scales. Their multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis reveals that the micro-scale time-series exhibits anticorrelated behaviour in contrast to the mid-scale one which is long-range correlated. Concerning the mid-scale one, in the range of 30 to 300 consecutive events the maximum entropy method power spectra indicates that it exhibits an 1/

              behaviour with
              α
              close to 1/3 which is compatible with the long-range correlations identified by detrended fluctuation analysis during periods of stationary seismicity. The results have been also verified to hold regionally for the earthquakes in Japan and shed light on the significance of the mid-scale of 30 to 300 events in the natural time analysis of global (and regional) seismicity. It is shown that when using the mid-scale time-series only, we can obtain results similar to those obtained by the natural time analysis of global seismicity when focusing on the prediction of earthquakes with

	abstract = {Abstract
            This supersedes Paper 1 (Gutenberg and Richter, 1942). Additional data are presented. Revisions involving intensity and acceleration are minor. The equation log a = I/3 − 1/2 is retained. The magnitude-energy relation is revised as follows:
            (20) log ⁡ E = 9.4 + 2.14 M − 0.054 M 2
            A numerical equivalent, for M from 1 to 8.6, is
            (21) log ⁡ E = 9.1 + 1.75 M + log ⁡ ( 9 − M )
            Equation (20) is based on
            (7) log ⁡ ( A 0 / T 0 ) = − 0.76 + 0.91 M − 0.027 M 2
            applying at an assumed point epicenter. Eq. (7) is derived empirically from readings of torsion seismometers and {USCGS} accelerographs. Amplitudes at the {USCGS} locations have been divided by an average factor of 2 1/2 to compensate for difference in ground; previously this correction was neglected, and log E was overestimated by 0.8. The terms M2 are due partly to the response of the torsion seismometers as affected by increase of ground period with M, partly to the use of surface waves to determine M. If {MS} results from surface waves, {MB} from body waves, approximately
            (27) M S − M B = 0.4 ( M S − 7 )
            It appears that {MB} corresponds more closely to the magnitude scale determined for local earthquakes.
            A complete revision of the magnitude scale, with appropriate tables and charts, is in preparation. This will probably be based on A/T rather than amplitudes.},

            The collision between India and Eurasia mobilizes multiple processes of continental tectonics. However, how deformation develops within the lithosphere across the Tibetan Plateau is still poorly known and a synoptic view is missing. Here, we exploit an extensive geodetic observatory to resolve the kinematics of this diffuse plate boundary and the arrangement of various mechanisms down to upper-mantle depths. The three-dimensional velocity field is compatible with continental underthrusting below the central Himalayas and with delamination rollback below the western syntaxis. The rise of the Tibetan Plateau occurs by shortening in the Indian and Asian crusts at its southern and northwestern margins. The subsidence of Central Tibet is associated with lateral extrusion and attendant lithospheric thinning aided by the downwelling current from the opposite-facing Indian and Asian collisions. The current kinematics of the Indian-Eurasian collision may reflect the differential evolution of the inner and outer Tibetan Plateau during the late Cenozoic.},

	abstract = {A review of the geologic history of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen suggests that at least 1400 km of north-south shortening has been absorbed by the orogen since the onset of the Indo-Asian collision at about 70 Ma. Significant crustal shortening, which leads to eventual construction of the Cenozoic Tibetan plateau, began more or less synchronously in the Eocene (50–40 Ma) in the Tethyan Himalaya in the south, and in the Kunlun Shan and the Qilian Shan some 1000–1400 km in the north. The Paleozoic and Mesozoic tectonic histories in the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen exerted a strong control over the Cenozoic strain history and strain distribution. The presence of widespread Triassic flysch complex in the Songpan-Ganzi-Hoh Xil and the Qiangtang terranes can be spatially correlated with Cenozoic volcanism and thrusting in central Tibet. The marked difference in seismic properties of the crust and the upper mantle between southern and central Tibet is a manifestation of both Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonics. The former, however, has played a decisive role in localizing Tertiary contractional deformation, which in turn leads to the release of free water into the upper mantle and the lower crust of central Tibet, causing partial melting in the mantle lithosphere and the crust.},

	abstract = {It is possible to use the waveform data not only to derive the source mechanism of an earthquake but also to establish the hypocentral coordinates of the ‘best point source’ (the centroid of the stress glut density) at a given frequency. Thus two classical problems of seismology are combined into a single procedure. Given an estimate of the origin time, epicentral coordinates and depth, an initial moment tensor is derived using one of the variations of the method described in detail by Gilbert and Dziewonski (1975). This set of parameters represents the starting values for an iterative procedure in which perturbations to the elements of the moment tensor are found simultaneously with changes in the hypocentral parameters. In general, the method is stable, and convergence rapid. Although the approach is a general one, we present it here in the context of the analysis of long‐period body wave data recorded by the instruments of the {SRO} and {ASRO} digital network. It appears that the upper magnitude limit of earthquakes that can be processed using this particular approach is between 7.5 and 8.0; the lower limit is, at this time, approximately 5.5, but it could be extended by broadening the passband of the analysis to include energy with periods shorter that 45 s. As there are hundreds of earthquakes each year with magnitudes exceeding 5.5, the seismic source mechanism can now be studied in detail not only for major events but also, for example, for aftershock series. We have investigated the foreshock and several aftershocks of the Sumba earthquake of August 19, 1977; the results show temporal variation of the stress regime in the fault area of the main shock. An area some 150 km to the northwest of the epicenter of the main event became seismically active 49 days later. The sense of the strike‐slip mechanism of these events is consistent with the relaxation of the compressive stress in the plate north of the Java trench. Another geophysically interesting result of our analysis is that for 5 out of 11 earthquakes of intermediate and great depth the intermediate principal value of the moment tensor is significant, while for the remaining 6 it is essentially zero, which means that their mechanisms are consistent with a simple double‐couple representation. There is clear distinction between these two groups of earthquakes.},

	abstract = {We compare synthetic and recorded P wave forms to place constraints on the focal depths and fault plane solutions of 16 crustal earthquakes beneath the highest parts ({\textgreater}4000 m) of the Tibetan plateau. Fault plane solutions for all 16 events show combinations of normal and strike slip faulting with T axes oriented approximately east–west. None of these solutions show thrust faulting. Thus the data corroborate previous inferences that the active tectonics are dominated by east–west extension. Focal depths for all 16 events are less than 15 km and appear to be between 5 and 10 km. This style of deformation and these depths of faulting are similar to those in the Basin and Range province of the western United States. Two intermediate depth events below the crust of southern Tibet also show primarily normal faulting with east–west T axes. The solution for one, discussed by Chen et al. (1981), is unambiguous. The solution for the other, the event of August 1, 1973 (27.59°N, 89.17°E, 85±10 km, m
              b
              = 4.9) is less certain. Both apparently occurred in the mantle beneath a thick, aseismic lower crust, and their occurrence suggests that brittle deformation occurs there in response to a stress field similar to that operating at shallow depths beneath Tibet.},

            Focal mechanism solutions of 12 recent earthquakes along the northern boundary of the Indian-Eurasian plates, from Hindukush to Burma, have been determined assuming the double-couple hypothesis. It has been found that the majority of earthquakes are of thrust type with the pressure directions acting at right angles to the faults/mountains, but, for a few of the earthquakes the orientations of the pressure directions are almost along the strike of the faults. Such observations could be partly explained in terms of the concept of “flake tectonics” as proposed for continent-continent collisions. A number of earthquakes in the eastern Himalayas and Burma show normal dip-slip or predominantly strike-slip movements. These anomalies call for further refinements of the plate theory in this zone of complicated deformation.},

            Tests of the stationary phase approximation method applied to P waves for the determination of focal mechanisms have been carried through for eight earthquakes selected from different geographic locations and depth ranges. The results are found to be in close agreement with the solutions obtained from S-wave polarization data for four earthquakes and in reasonable agreement for three earthquakes. In general, however, the P polarities are more consistent with S-wave polarization solutions than with the solutions obtained by the present method. The stationary phase solutions agree with the P-wave spectrum solutions determined in a previous study. The method is applicable to shallow-focus earthquakes, and to earthquakes of large magnitude in which methods using S-wave polarization data and P-wave spectra are difficult to apply.},

            A method has been proposed for the combination of P-wave first-motion directions and S-wave polarization data for the numerical determination of earthquake focal mechanism. The method takes into account the influence of nearness of stations with inconsistent P-wave polarity observations, with respect to the assumed nodal planes. The mechanism solutions for six earthquakes selected from different geographic locations and depth ranges have been determined. Equal area projections of the nodal planes together with the P-wave first-motion and S-wave polarization data are presented for each earthquake. The quality of resolution of nodal plane determination on the basis of P-wave data, S-wave polarization, and the combination of P and S-wave data according to the present method, is discussed.},

              We study the 3‐D variation of the crustal structure of the Sikkim Himalaya using broadband seismological data acquired from a focused network of seven stations spanning the Lesser, Higher, and Tethyan Himalaya. Common conversion point stacking of receiver functions recorded along an across‐strike profile of the Himalaya reveals first‐order northward dip on the Main Himalayan Thrust ({MHT}), a midcrustal discontinuity and the Moho, along with higher‐order lateral variations. Three‐dimensional images generated from joint inversion of receiver functions and surface wave dispersions show that the {MHT} has a ramp‐flat‐ramp geometry. The ramps are located beneath the Lesser Himalaya and the Tethyan Himalaya with dips of ∼7

              and ∼15

              , respectively, connected by flat segments. The ramp beneath the Lesser Himalaya forms a dome structure, upwarping the thrust sheets associated with the Peling and Main Central Thrust. The erosional surface of this dome forms the arcuate geometry of thrusts observed in the Lesser Himalaya. The thickness of the underthrust Indian crust is 35–42 km and has an average

These are intersected by steeply dipping transverse low‐velocity zones, oblique to the strike of the Himalaya. We conjecture that these low‐velocity zones are the dextral‐strike slip faults known to be active beneath the Sikkim Himalaya. The observed alternate shallow and deep segments of the Moho must be a consequence of several cycles of strike‐slip displacement on these transverse faults.

            Plain Language Summary
            Sikkim is an Indian state between Nepal and Bhutan. The style of convergence between India and Eurasia changes from head‐on collision (Nepal Himalaya) to oblique convergence (Eastern Himalaya) across this region (Sikkim Himalaya). We study the crustal structure of this region using broadband seismological data recorded by a local network of stations. The Main Himalayan Thrust ({MHT}) separates the downgoing Indian Plate from the overriding Himalayan wedge. The {MHT} and the other major discontinuities within the crust, viz., the Moho and the midcrustal discontinuity are seen to dip northward. But all of these discontinuities also have higher‐order lateral variations. The {MHT} has a ramp‐flat‐ramp geometry with two ramps in the Lesser Himalaya and the Tethyan Himalaya, respectively. The ramp in the Lesser Himalaya is like a dome and upwarps the overlying thrust faults. The thickness and average shear wave velocity of underthrusting Indian crust is very similar to that of the Peninsular Indian crust. The Moho also has dome‐like structure separated by elongated, deeper sections trending {NW}‐{SE}. We conjecture that these alternate shallow and deep segments of the Moho are a consequence of several cycles of strike‐slip displacements on transverse faults known to be active here.

	abstract = {The seismic cycle on a major fault involves long periods of elastic strain and stress accumulation, driven by aseismic ductile deformation at depth, ultimately released by sudden fault slip events. Coseismic slip distributions are generally heterogeneous with most of the energy being released in the rupture of asperities. Since, on the long term, the fault's walls generally do not accumulate any significant permanent deformation, interseismic deformation might be heterogeneous, revealing zones of focused stress buildup. The pattern of current deformation along the Himalayan arc, which is known to produce recurring devastating earthquakes, and where several seismic gaps have long been recognized, might accordingly show significant lateral variations, providing a possible explanation for the uneven microseismic activity along the Himalayan arc. By contrast, the geodetic measurements show a rather uniform pattern of interseismic strain, oriented consistently with long‐term geological deformation, as indicated from stretching lineation. We show that the geodetic data and seismicity distribution are reconciled from a model in which microseismicity is interpreted as driven by stress buildup increase in the interseismic period. The uneven seismicity pattern is shown to reflect the impact of the topography on the stress field, indicating low deviatoric stresses ({\textless}35 {MPa}) and a low friction ({\textless}0.3) on the Main Himalayan Thrust. Arc‐normal thrusting along the Himalayan front and east‐west extension in southern Tibet are quantitatively reconciled by the model.},

            On January 19, 1975 an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 occurred in the border districts of Himachal Pradesh, India. The earthquake caused considerable loss of life and varying degrees of damage to construction in the area. Traditional and recent buildings suffered extensive damage. Landslides, rock falls and avalanches caused considerable damage to the Hindustan-Tibet road. Extensive fissures in the ground developed at the epicenter. Greatest damage was noted along the N-S trending Kaurik-Chango fault following the Parachu and Spiti river valleys, suggesting its genetic interrelationship with the earthquake.},

	abstract = {{SUMMARY}
            The stress regime patterns of high-seismically active regions within the western part of the India–Eurasia collision, spanning from 67° E to 83° E and 27° N to 39° N, are elucidated through analysis of 684 Focal Mechanism Solutions from 1962 to 2021. Eighteen seismically active zones used for the stress tensor inversion, are defined based on the spatial extent of the seismicity, the depth distribution of seismic events, focal mechanism studies, and seismotectonics of the region. The defined regimes are: (1) Sulaiman Ranges and Lobe Region, (2) Hindukush, (3) Pamir, (4) Nanga Parbat Syntaxis, (5) Hazara Syntaxis, (6) Kashmir–Zanskar region, (7) Kangra–Chamba, (8) Kinnaur and Kaurik–Chango fault zone ({KCFZ}), (9) Garhwal, (10) Kumaon, (11) Karakoram fault zone, and (12) Gozha–Ashikule fault zone. Seismicity is reported only in the crust or up to mid-crust in most of the regions, except for the Pamir and Hindukush, where the seismicity can be observed down to 160 and 280 km, respectively. We report a clockwise rotation of the maximum horizontal stress ({SHmax}) of about 42° and 21° in the Hindukush and Pamir regions, respectively. with increasing focal depths from north west to north. The region where major and strong earthquakes occur indicates pure compressive regimes. Most of the zones support transpressive and transtensional tectonics with a few zones by normal and strike-slip fault regimes. Regions like Nanga Parbat syntaxis, Kinnaur, {KCFZ}, and Zanskar are exceptions, where extensional and transformational tectonic features dominate. Plate convergence force has less effect on defining the stress regime in the Karakoram fault zone and Gozha–Ashikule regions, which display transtensional and pure extensional regimes, respectively. Underthrusting of the Indian plate through complex tectonics is indicated by dominant compression stresses with evidences of normal, strike-slip, and oblique fault mechanisms.},

            An analytical method, called the “multiple filter technique,” is shown to be a fast and efficient means of studying multi-mode dispersed signals. Amplitudes and phases, as functions of period and velocity, are determined from the output of a set of narrow-band digital filters. The group velocities and other dispersion parameters determined by this technique are concordant with theoretical values when the method is tested with synthetic seismograms. It can recover broader portions of the dispersion present in ordinary seismic recordings compared to the classical peak and trough method. A simple diagnostic diagram is introduced in order to study the time and frequency resolution permitted by this analytic technique.},
